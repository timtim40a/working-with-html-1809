      <h1>INT CAFE - Evening</h1>

      <p>
        [A quiet, dimly lit café. A young woman, LISA (mid-20s), sits at a
        corner table, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. The door opens with a
        soft chime, and JAMES (late 20s) walks in, scanning the room.]
      </p>

      <p>CAMERA: Medium shot – James enters, pausing at the door.</p>

      <p>
        JAMES <br />
        (softly, hesitant) <br />
        Lisa?
      </p>

      <p>CAMERA: Close-up – Lisa looks up, surprised.</p>

      <p>
        LISA <br />
        (smirking) <br />
        You actually showed up.
      </p>

      <p>
        CAMERA: Over-the-shoulder – James approaches, hesitant. He pulls out the
        chair opposite her and sits down.
      </p>

      <p>
        JAMES <br />
        (nods) <br />
        Yeah... I thought we should talk.
      </p>

      <p>
        CAMERA: Two-shot – Both in frame, tension lingering. Lisa sighs, tapping
        her fingers against her mug.
      </p>

      <p>
        LISA <br />
        You realise it’s been two years?
      </p>

      <p>
        JAMES <br />
        I know.
      </p>

      <p>(beat)</p>

      <p>
        JAMES <br />
        I just... I wasn't ready before.
      </p>

      <p>
        CAMERA: Close-up on Lisa – She studies him, trying to read his
        intentions.
      </p>

      <p>
        LISA <br />
        And now you are?
      </p>

      <p>[JAMES hesitates, then nods.]</p>

      <p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
